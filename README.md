## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

The challenge is to build out this contact form and get it looking as close to the requested design as possible. And paying particular attention to making this form accessible. Building accessible forms is a key skill for front-end developers. So this is a perfect challenge to make as our Alx portfolio project.

The users should be able to:

- Complete the form and see a success toast message upon successful submission
- Receive form validation messages if:
  - A required field has been missed
  - The email address is not formatted correctly
- Complete the form only using their keyboard
- Have inputs, error messages, and the success message announced on their screen reader
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Tailwind CSS
- Mobile-first workflow
- Formik & Yup libararies
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library
- [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - React framework

### What I learned

Sharpening some skills and getting more experienced with some frameworks as Nextjsm Formik and Yup are the most major learning skills i learned while making this project.
Coding gets more easier and code lines productions gets faster each time i keep practicing and sharpening my skills.

### Continued development

I am planing to get in touch with some more complicated forms, and get comfortable handeling too much traffic and request on my page.
